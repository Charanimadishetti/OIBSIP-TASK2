                <li>Ambedkar played a key role in the formation of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 1935.
                    Back in 1955, he was the first person to propose the partition of Madhya Pradesh and
                     Bihar for better government. He also wanted to make Sanskrit the Indian union's official 
                     language and he took part in the 'Lok Sabha' election twice but failed to win on both 
                     occasions. 'Waiting for a Visa,' his autobiography, is used as a textbook at Columbia 
                     University. He was opposed to the principle of employment and constituency reservation
                      and didn't want the system to exist at all. He was the first Indian to earn a Ph.D.
                       degree outside of India. Ambedkar was the one who pushed for a reduction in India's 
                       working hours from 14 to eight hours a day. He was a vocal opponent of the Indian 
                       constitution's 'Article 370,' which granted the state of Jammu and Kashmir special
                        status. </li>

                       of 25 rupees per month to Ambedkar. Ambedkar used all that money to continue his 
                       studies outside India. He applied for Columbia University in New York to complete his
